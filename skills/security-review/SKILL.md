description: Use this skill when adding authentication, handling user input, working with secrets, creating API endpoints, or implementing payment/sensitive features. Provides comprehensive security checklist and patterns.
when_to_use: Use when code touches authentication, secrets, user input, file uploads, payments, third-party APIs, or other sensitive surfaces.

# Security Review Skill

Ensures all code follows security best practices and identifies potential vulnerabilities.

## When to Activate

- Implementing authentication or authorization
- Handling user input or file uploads
- Creating new API endpoints
- Working with secrets or credentials
- Implementing payment features
- Storing or transmitting sensitive data
- Integrating third-party APIs

## Security Checklist Categories

Review each category. See `references/vulnerability-patterns.md` for WRONG/CORRECT code examples.

1. **Secrets Management** -- No hardcoded secrets; all in env vars; `.env*` gitignored
2. **Input Validation** -- Schema validation (zod); file upload size/type/extension checks
3. **SQL Injection** -- Parameterized queries only; no string concatenation
4. **Auth & Authorization** -- httpOnly cookies; RBAC; Supabase RLS enabled
5. **XSS Prevention** -- DOMPurify for user HTML; CSP headers configured
6. **CSRF Protection** -- CSRF tokens on state-changing ops; SameSite=Strict cookies
7. **Rate Limiting** -- All endpoints rate-limited; stricter on expensive operations
8. **Data Exposure** -- No secrets in logs; generic error messages to users
9. **Blockchain** -- Wallet signatures verified; transaction validation; balance checks
10. **Dependencies** -- `npm audit` clean; lock files committed; Dependabot enabled

**Security is not optional.** One vulnerability can compromise the entire platform. When in doubt, err on the side of caution.
